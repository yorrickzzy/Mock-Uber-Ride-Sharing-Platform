Danger Log – HW1 Mock Uber Project
---------------------------------

1. Role Confusion Between Passenger and Driver
------------------------------------------------
In this project, a user can act as both a passenger and a driver. A major danger is allowing a user
to perform driver-only actions (such as searching open rides or confirming rides) without being
properly registered as a driver. This initially caused runtime errors when accessing DriverProfile
objects that did not exist.

Mitigation:
We added explicit driver existence checks before all driver-related views. If a user is not
registered as a driver, the system now blocks driver-only access instead of crashing.

2. Inactive Driver Accepting Open Rides
---------------------------------------
Another concern was that inactive drivers are able to search for open rides and confirm them, 
promising users something that will never come.

Mitigation:
Similar to role confusion, we added additional validation to determine whether a driver has access 
to searching for open rides

3. Driver Confirming Their Own Ride
-----------------------------------
Another dangerous edge case is allowing a user to confirm their own ride request after registering
as a driver. This creates an invalid logical state where the same user is both rider and driver for
a single ride.

Mitigation:
We explicitly check whether the ride owner matches the current driver user. If so, the confirmation
is rejected and a clear error message ("You are not allowed to confirm your own ride") is displayed.

4. Silent Failures Due to Over-Redirecting
------------------------------------------
Originally, some invalid operations (e.g., unauthorized ride confirmation) simply redirected users
back to the previous page without explanation. This can confuse users and hide bugs during testing.

Mitigation:
We replaced silent redirects with Django messages so users receive immediate and explicit feedback
when an action is not permitted.

5. Unauthorized Ride Modification by Sharers
------------------------------------------
In this project, a ride request can have one owner and multiple sharers. A potential danger is
allowing sharers to modify ride details such as destination, requested time, or number of passengers.
This could lead to unauthorized changes and inconsistent ride information after a driver has already
confirmed the ride.

Mitigation:
We restricted ride update and cancel actions to the ride owner only. Sharers are limited to joining
or leaving a ride, ensuring that only the original requester can modify ride details.
